## InteractiveAnimation (Briefly introduced)
 *This project was prepared for us to graduate from university. (Dissertation)*

 The aim of project is to contribute educative to children's time of watching a cartoon. 
 The children's age should be between 3 and 6.
 
 We made animations using **VYOND** that provides making free animation.

 Controller device : Anroid Phone
 
 Watching device   : Windows PC - 1
 
 Server device     : Windows PC - 2

 We developed all of the needed applications on Unity. 
 We are needed to an application, which runs on Android phones, that provides the user to input something that is answers for asked questions while watching animation.

 We are needed also the other application, which runs on the server-side, that provides some other properties. For instance, which animation to be sent to the watching device? The user selects one topic of those that include animals, colors, and fruits then the path is continued according to the user answers.
 The application has that and many other features.
 
 Also on the server-side machine was used **Apache WampServer** that supplies technologies such as **MySQL**, **PHP** and so on.
 
 Finally, we need the last application that provides the user to watch animations. We developed a basic media player application. The application hasn't many features. Only to be sent animation from the server is played.
